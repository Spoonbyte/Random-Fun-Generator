# Objective
To practice using a makefile to understand how they work.
Up to this point I've only used manual compiling to do my simple programs but now I'm 
learning a more complicated github repo ( https://github.com/mrnorman/miniWeather ) 
that uses Cmake so I need to understand the makefile system.

# Description
This is essentially an overly complicated "hello world" program. It uses 3 files:
* cmake_practice.cpp
  * Call the function hellow()
* function.cpp
  * Creates the function hellow()
* function.h
  * Defines the function hellow() for use in cmake_practice.cpp

# Outcome
Was able to use the makefile I created to successfully compile and run the program "main.exe"!

# Resources
This video was great at explaining the reason why make and Cmake are useful
