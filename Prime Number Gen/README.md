Objective: 
Create a project to introduce me to parallel programming (OpenMP).

Description:
This project is an expansion on a prime number generator that I created for a textbook problem I solved.
The way I initially wrote the program led me to think that I could check each numbers' primality in parallel.
I wanted to allow the user to generate as many prime numbers as they want and have it optimized to run in parallel using OpenMP 
(not sure if OpenMP is even the best way to solve this problem...).

The project is written in C++ and uses the OpenMP API.
